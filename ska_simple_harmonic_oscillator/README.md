## Experimental Results

![Entropy and Position Evolution](harmonic_oscillator_entropy.png)

*Real-time entropy and position evolution for a simple harmonic oscillator analyzed through the SKA framework using exact discretization.*

## Interpretation

### Entropy Patterns (Top Panel)
- **Logarithmic scale**: Entropy ranges from 10^-5 to 10^4 (5 orders of magnitude)
- **Periodic minima**: Regular drops to ultra-low entropy (~10^-5)
- **Perfect rhythm**: Entropy minima occur with precise temporal spacing
- **Information windows**: Each minimum represents a moment of maximum predictability

### Position Dynamics (Bottom Panel)  
- **Clean oscillation**: Smooth sinusoidal motion between -1 and +1
- **Exact discretization**: No numerical drift or artifacts
- **Perfect periodicity**: Consistent amplitude and frequency

## Key Discovery: Entropy-Position Correlation

### At Turning Points (Position = ±1):
- **Velocity → 0**: Kinematic certainty
- **Entropy → minimum**: Information predictability peak
- **System state**: Maximally deterministic moment

### At Zero Crossings (Position = 0):
- **Maximum velocity**: Rapid state transition
- **Entropy peaks**: Information uncertainty maximum  
- **System state**: Most unpredictable moment

## Scientific Significance

**Information Rhythm Discovery**
- First observation of intrinsic information structure in simple harmonic motion
- Demonstrates that physical systems have natural "predictability windows"
- Shows exact discretization preserves hidden entropy patterns

**Real-Time Unsupervised Analysis**
- No prior knowledge of oscillation frequency required
- SKA autonomously discovers periodic structure from entropy patterns
- Enables real-time frequency extraction: ω = 2π / (entropy_period)

** Universal Principle**
- Pattern extends to any oscillatory system
- Foundation for multi-mode and complex harmonic analysis
- Bridge between classical mechanics and information theory

## Technical Parameters

```python
# Oscillator Configuration
omega = 0.15          # Angular frequency (rad/s)
epsilon = 0.1        # Time step (s)
x0 = 1.0            # Initial position
v0 = 0.0            # Initial velocity
duration = 464       # Analysis time (s)

# SKA Analysis
method = "exact_discretization"  # Cieśliński & Ratkiewicz (2005)
entropy_calculation = "continuous_approximation"
sampling_rate = 1/epsilon  # 5 Hz
```

## Implications for Complex Systems

This simple harmonic result establishes the foundation for:

1. **Multi-oscillator systems**: Superposition and beating patterns
2. **Nonlinear dynamics**: Chaotic and quasi-periodic motion
3. **Real-world applications**: Seismic, biological, financial time series
4. **Unsupervised discovery**: Autonomous frequency and pattern detection

## Mathematical Foundation

The entropy calculation follows the SKA continuous formulation:

```
H = -1/ln(2) ∫ z dD
```

Where the exact discretization preserves all information content, allowing SKA to reveal the hidden information architecture of harmonic motion.
